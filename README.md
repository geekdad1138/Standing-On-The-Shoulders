# Standing on the Shoulders

A love letter and map to the founders of computing and AI.

## The Idea

We didn't get here by accident. We got here step by step, through people who didn't know they were changing the world yet.

This isn't a Wikipedia clone. It's not a textbook. It's a **lineage**. A **provenance**. Why the buttons mattered, not just who pressed them.

## No Breakthroughs. Just Stacked Insights.

We tell ourselves stories about lone geniuses. A single person in a lab, alone with an idea, suddenly inventing the future.

That's a myth.

Every breakthrough was built on inherited ideas. Every innovator stood on the shoulders of those who came before.

This project makes that visible.

## How It Works

Each entry shows:

- **The Person** – Who they were
- **What They Inherited** – The ideas they built upon
- **What They Passed On** – Their contribution to what came next

Think of it as a **dependency graph for thought**.

From Alan Turing to John McCarthy to Marvin Minsky to Geoffrey Hinton to Transformer Models. Each person connected to the next. Each idea flowing into the next.

## Why This Matters

If you want to understand modern AI, you need to understand:

- Why the Dartmouth Conference mattered
- What the Turing Test was really asking
- How "attention is all you need" changed everything
- Who were the people behind these ideas, and what inspired them

This is a way to learn the names of the people who got us here. To understand not just *what* changed, but *why* and *how*.

## A Work in Progress

We're building this. Content is being added. Connections are being drawn.

But the idea is here: celebrating the founders, honoring the lineage, and showing how we truly did get here together.
