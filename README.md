# Standing on the Shoulders

A love letter and map to the founders of computing and AI.

## The Idea

We didn't get here by accident. We got here step by step, through people who didn't know they were changing the world yet. 

This isn't a Wikipedia clone. It's not a textbook. It's a **lineage**. A **provenance**. Why the buttons mattered, not just who pressed them.

## No Breakthroughs. Just Stacked Insights.

We tell ourselves stories about lone geniuses. A single person in a lab, alone with an idea, suddenly inventing the future. That's a myth.

Every breakthrough was built on inherited ideas. Every innovator stood on the shoulders of those who came before. This project makes that visible.

## How It Works

Each entry in this repository shows:

- **The Person** – Who they were.
- **What They Inherited** – The ideas and technologies they built upon.
- **What They Passed On** – Their contribution to what came next.

Think of it as a **dependency graph for thought**. From Alan Turing to John McCarthy to Geoffrey Hinton to the Transformer models, each idea flows into the next.

## Explore the Lineage

The history of AI is a chain of hand-offs. You can browse the full directory in the [lineage folder](./docs/lineage/), or follow the primary thread below:

## Visualizing the Map

Because this project is a **dependency graph for thought**, we maintain a live-rendered map of the connections between every figure in the lineage.

### The Timeline of Influence

| Era | Key Figure / Group | The "Shoulder" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1837** | [Charles Babbage](./docs/lineage/1837-Charles-Babbage.md) | The Mechanical Foundation |
| **1843** | [Ada Lovelace](./docs/lineage/1843-Ada-Lovelace.md) | The First Logic Hand-off |
| **1936** | [Alan Turing](./docs/lineage/1936-Alan-Turing.md) | The Universal Machine |
| **1947** | [The Transistor Team](./docs/lineage/1947-The-Transistor-Team.md) | Logic becomes Physical |
| **1948** | [Claude Shannon](./docs/lineage/1948-Claude-Shannon.md) | Information Theory & Bits |
| **1956** | [The Dartmouth Founders](./docs/lineage/1956-The-Dartmouth-Founders.md) | The Formal Birth of AI |

## Why This Matters

If you want to understand modern AI, you need to understand not just *what* changed, but *why* and *how*. 

- Why the Dartmouth Conference mattered.
- What the Turing Test was really asking.
- How "Attention is All You Need" changed everything.

This is a way to learn the names of the people who got us here and to honor the lineage of ideas that define our world.

## A Work in Progress

We are actively building this map. Content is being added, and connections are being drawn. This project celebrates the founders by showing how we truly did get here together.
