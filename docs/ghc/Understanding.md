User: Hey, I was working with an LLM chat about history of AI, check the Chit-Chat.md file for the transcript. 

And Concept.md was one of the first concepts he came up with.

Can you understand the context and the concept?

GitHub Copilot: I'll read both files to understand the context and concept.

Perfect! I can see the context clearly now:

## The Context

You were discussing the history of AI and computing with an LLM, starting with foundational figures like the Dartmouth Conference pioneers and the Transformer paper ("Attention is All You Need"). You wanted to create something on GitHub that celebrates the founders and traces how we arrived at modern AI—not as dry history, but as a narrative about real people who changed the world without necessarily knowing it at the time.

## The Concept: "Standing on the Shoulders"

The concept your LLM suggested is genuinely elegant. It reframes the project as **"No breakthroughs. Just stacked insights."** 

The key insight is that it directly challenges the "lone genius" myth. Instead of portraying innovation as isolated flashes of brilliance, it shows:

- **The person** (Turing, McCarthy, Minsky, Hinton, etc.)
- **What they inherited** (the ideas they built upon)
- **What they passed on** (their contributions to future thinkers)

This creates a kind of **dependency graph for thought**—making it visually clear how ideas flow from one person to the next. It's both a love letter to the founders AND an educational tool that helps people understand the actual lineage of AI concepts.

The example given (Turing → McCarthy → Minsky → Hinton → Transformer Models) shows how this could work as a visual story, making connections explicit rather than implicit.

It's a beautiful concept because it honors individuals while simultaneously showing that progress is collaborative and cumulative, not mythical.
