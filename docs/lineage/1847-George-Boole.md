### **1. The Logic Foundation: George Boole (1847)**

#### **The Person**

An English mathematician who realized that logic—previously a branch of philosophy—could be treated as a branch of mathematics. He created a system where thoughts could be calculated.

#### **What He Inherited (The Shoulders)**

* **Aristotle:** Inherited the concept of "Syllogisms" (if A is B, and B is C, then A is C) but moved it from words to variables.
* **Algebraic Notation:** Inherited standard math symbols but applied them to "True" and "False" instead of numbers.

#### **What He Passed On**

* **Boolean Algebra:** He passed on the $1$ and $0$ logic. Without his math, we wouldn't have "AND," "OR," or "NOT" gates in our chips.
* **Claude Shannon (1948):** This is the direct link. Shannon used Boole's 100-year-old math to prove that electrical circuits could solve any logical problem.
