## **The Dartmouth Founders: The Birth of AI (1956)**

### **The People**

The "Founding Four" who authored the proposal:

* **John McCarthy:** A mathematician who coined the term "Artificial Intelligence."
* **Marvin Minsky:** A cognitive scientist focused on how minds and machines learn.
* **Claude Shannon:** The "Father of Information Theory."
* **Nathaniel Rochester:** The designer of the IBM 701 (IBM's first commercial computer).

### **What They Inherited (The Shared Shoulders)**

This group didn't start from zero; they were standing on the shoulders of the giants who defined the 1930s and 40s:

* **Alan Turing:** They inherited the **Turing Machine** and the provocative question, "Can machines think?" McCarthy specifically wanted to move past Turing’s "imitation game" into a formal science.
* **John von Neumann:** They inherited the **Stored-Program Architecture**. Without a computer that could store instructions as data, their dream of "simulating learning" would have been impossible.
* **Norbert Wiener:** They inherited **Cybernetics** (the study of feedback loops). McCarthy chose the name "Artificial Intelligence" specifically to distinguish their work from Wiener’s analog, biology-heavy approach.

### **What They Passed On**

The "Dartmouth Click" created the shoulders that every modern AI researcher stands on today:

* **The Formal Field:** They passed on the name **"Artificial Intelligence"** and the belief that "every aspect of learning... can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."
* **The Next Generation:** From this workshop came the "shoulders" for **LISP** (McCarthy), **Neural Networks** (Minsky's early work), and **Expert Systems**.
* **The Institutions:** This meeting directly led to the creation of the AI labs at **MIT**, **Stanford**, and **CMU**.

### **How this fits the "Shoulders" Map**

In your `lineage/` folder, this file acts as a "Hub." It takes the individual threads of Babbage, Lovelace, and Turing and weaves them into the "State of the Art" that would eventually lead to the Transformer.

**Do you want to continue the chain by looking at one of the proteges who stood on these shoulders? We could do:**

1. **Marvin Minsky → Frank Rosenblatt** (The battle over the Perceptron).
2. **John McCarthy → LISP & Symbolic AI** (How he built a language for the mind).
3. **The Intel 4004 Team** (How hardware caught up to the Dartmouth dreams).
