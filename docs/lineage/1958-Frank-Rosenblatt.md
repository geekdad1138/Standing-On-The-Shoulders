## **Frank Rosenblatt: The Perceptron (1958)**

### **The Person**

Frank Rosenblatt was a psychologist and pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. Unlike the "Symbolic" AI crowd (McCarthy/Minsky) who wanted to program logic, Rosenblatt wanted to build a machine that could **learn** from experience, much like an eye or a brain.

### **What He Inherited (The Shoulders)**

Rosenblatt took the biological theories of the 1940s and turned them into the first functional neural network:

* **Warren McCulloch & Walter Pitts:** He inherited the **McCulloch-Pitts Neuron (1943)**. They had proven that a simplified mathematical model of a biological neuron could perform logic. Rosenblatt took their "static" model and made it "plastic" (capable of changing).
* **Donald Hebb:** He inherited **Hebbian Theory (1949)**—the idea that "neurons that fire together, wire together." Rosenblatt used this concept of "weighting" connections to create the Perceptron’s learning rule.
* **The Transistor Team:** He inherited the **Physical Switch**. To build his "Mark I Perceptron" (a 5-ton machine), he needed the physical ability to connect sensors (photocells) to motor-driven potentiometers that acted as the "weights."

### **What He Passed On**

Rosenblatt is the "Great Grandfather" of modern Deep Learning. Without him, the "Connectionist" movement might have died in the 50s:

* **The Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** He passed on the fundamental architecture—Input  Weights  Summation  Output—that every LLM still uses today.
* **Geoffrey Hinton:** He passed on the "Connectionist" torch. When Minsky and Papert later criticized the Perceptron (causing an AI Winter), it was Rosenblatt’s vision that Hinton eventually revived and perfected with **Backpropagation**.
* **Computer Vision:** He passed on the dream of "Perception." His machine was the first that could be "shown" a card and learn to recognize if it was a square or a circle without being told the rules of geometry.
