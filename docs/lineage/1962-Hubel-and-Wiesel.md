### **1. The Biological Foundation: Hubel & Wiesel (1962)**

#### **The People**

David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, neurophysiologists whose Nobel Prize-winning research mapped how the brain's visual cortex actually works.

#### **What They Inherited**

* **Santiago Ramón y Cajal:** The "Father of Neuroscience" who first mapped individual neurons.
* **The Cathode Ray Tube:** They used early electronic monitors to show patterns to cats while recording their brain activity.

#### **What They Passed On**

* **Simple & Complex Cells:** They discovered that certain neurons only fire for specific "features" (like a vertical line). This passed the concept of **Feature Extraction** to computer science.
* **Hierarchical Processing:** They showed that the brain builds complex images from simple shapes. This is the direct "shoulder" for **Multilayer Neural Networks**.
