## **Minsky & Papert: The Stress Test (1969)**

### **The People**

* **Marvin Minsky:** A Dartmouth founder and leader of the MIT AI Lab.
* **Seymour Papert:** A pioneer in constructionist learning and co-director of the MIT AI Lab.

### **What They Inherited (The Shoulders)**

* **Frank Rosenblatt:** They inherited the **Perceptron**. They didn't just stand on his work; they scrutinized it to see if it could scale.
* **The Dartmouth Vision:** They inherited the goal of creating "General AI" but believed the "Connectionist" (neural network) approach of the 1950s was a dead end compared to symbolic logic.

### **What They Passed On**

This entry is famous for what it *paused*, but also what it eventually *produced*:

* **The XOR Problem:** They passed on a mathematical proof showing that simple neural networks couldn't solve non-linear problems (like the XOR gate). This effectively shut down funding for neural networks for over a decade.
* **The AI Winter:** They passed on a shift in focus toward **Symbolic AI** (Expert Systems), which dominated the 1970s and 80s.
* **The Challenge for Backpropagation:** By pointing out exactly where the Perceptron failed, they passed on a "map of the gap." This map was exactly what **Geoffrey Hinton** and others used in the 1980s to develop **Multi-layer Perceptrons** and **Backpropagation** to prove Minsky and Papert's limitations could be overcome.
