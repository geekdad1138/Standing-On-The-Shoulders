### **2. The Architectural Bridge: Kunihiko Fukushima (1980)**

#### **The Person**

A Japanese scientist who wanted to build a machine that could recognize patterns regardless of where they appeared in the field of vision.

#### **What He Inherited**

* **Hubel & Wiesel (1962):** He explicitly built the **Neocognitron** to mimic their "Simple/Complex cell" model.
* **Frank Rosenblatt (1958):** He inherited the dream of the Perceptron but realized a single layer wasn't enough for vision.

#### **What He Passed On**

* **The Neocognitron:** The first hierarchical, multilayered network.
* **Spatial Invariance:** He passed on the logic of "Pooling" (taking the best feature from an area), which allowed Yann LeCun to later create the **Convolutional Neural Network**.
