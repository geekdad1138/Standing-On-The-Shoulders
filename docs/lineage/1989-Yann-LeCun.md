## **Yann LeCun: Convolutional Neural Networks (1989)**

### **The Person**

Yann LeCun, a French computer scientist and researcher at Bell Labs (and later Meta). He is one of the "Godfathers of AI." He realized that standard neural networks were "blind" to the spatial structure of images, and he set out to build a machine that could see patterns, not just pixels.

### **What He Inherited (The Shoulders)**

LeCun’s breakthrough was a synthesis of 1960s biology and 1980s mathematics:

* **The Backprop Team (1986):** He inherited the **Backpropagation algorithm**. LeCun was one of the first to prove that you could use Backprop to train a multi-layer network to perform complex, real-world tasks like handwriting recognition.
* **Kunihiko Fukushima:** He inherited the **Neocognitron (1980)**. Fukushima had proposed a hierarchical network inspired by biology, but it lacked a clear way to learn. LeCun stood on Fukushima's architectural shoulders and added the "engine" of Backprop.
* **Hubel & Wiesel (1962):** He inherited the **Biological Visual Cortex** model. These two neurophysiologists won a Nobel Prize for discovering that the brain processes images using local "receptive fields." LeCun translated this biology into the mathematical "Convolution."

### **What He Passed On**

LeCun provided the "Visual Shoulder" that modern AI is built upon:

* **LeNet-5:** He passed on the first practical, commercial application of deep learning. His "LeNet" was used by banks to read 10% of all checks written in the US in the late 90s.
* **The CNN Architecture:** He passed on the **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. Every image-recognition system today—from your iPhone's FaceID to Tesla’s Autopilot—is a direct descendant of his 1989 work.
* **AlexNet (2012):** He passed the torch to the next generation. When **Alex Krizhevsky** and **Geoffrey Hinton** crushed the ImageNet competition in 2012, they were using a modern, scaled-up version of LeCun’s 1989 CNN.
