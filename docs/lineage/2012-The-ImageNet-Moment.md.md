### **2. The Deep Learning Big Bang: 2012 — The ImageNet Moment**

#### **The People**

**Alex Krizhevsky**, **Ilya Sutskever**, and **Geoffrey Hinton**. Their paper, "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" (often called **AlexNet**), changed the world almost overnight.

#### **What They Inherited (The Shoulders)**

* **Yann LeCun (1989):** They inherited the **CNN architecture**. AlexNet was essentially a much larger, "deeper" version of LeCun’s LeNet.
* **The Intel 4004 Team (1971) & NVIDIA:** They inherited the **GPU**. They realized that chips built for video games were perfectly designed for the parallel math of neural networks.
* **Fei-Fei Li (2009):** They stood on the shoulders of the **ImageNet dataset**. Without her 14 million labeled images, the network wouldn't have had enough data to learn complex features.

#### **What They Passed On**

* **The Deep Learning Era:** They passed on the definitive proof that bigger data + bigger compute + neural networks = superhuman performance.
* **Modern Computer Vision:** This moment is why your phone can recognize your face and cars can see pedestrians today.
* **The AI Renaissance:** This success triggered the massive wave of investment that led to OpenAI, DeepMind, and the current LLM boom.
