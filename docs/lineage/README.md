# The Lineage Gallery: Standing on Shoulders

This folder contains the core data of the project: the individual profiles that make up our **dependency graph for thought**.

## 🗺️ Visual Map
If you want to see how these thinkers connect across time and disciplines, check out our interactive graph:

## Navigation
The files are named using a `YYYY-Name.md` format. This ensures that when you browse this folder, you are seeing the literal timeline of AI and computing evolve in chronological order.

### The Standard Template
Every file in this folder follows a strict **"Inheritance"** structure to ensure we never lose sight of the connections:

* **What They Inherited:** Who were they reading? Whose lab did they work in? What math were they using?
* **The Contribution:** The specific "click" or breakthrough they are known for.
* **What They Passed On:** Who stood on their shoulders next?
