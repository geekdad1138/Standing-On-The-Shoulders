# The Lineage Gallery

This folder contains the core data of the project: the individual profiles that make up our **dependency graph for thought**.

## Navigation
The files are named using a `YYYY-Name.md` format. This ensures that when you browse this folder, you are seeing the literal timeline of AI and computing evolve in chronological order.

### The Standard Template
Every file in this folder follows a strict "Inheritance" structure to ensure we never lose sight of the connections:

- **What They Inherited:** Who were they reading? Whose lab did they work in? What math were they using?
- **The Contribution:** The specific "click" or breakthrough they are known for.
- **What They Passed On:** Who stood on their shoulders next?

## Current Branches
- **The Mechanical Era:** Babbage & Lovelace
- **The Logic Era:** Turing & Shannon
- **The Physical Era:** The Transistor Team & Intel
- **The AI Era:** The Dartmouth Founders & Rosenblatt
