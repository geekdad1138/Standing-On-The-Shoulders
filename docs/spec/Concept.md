#  Standing on the Shoulders 

**Tagline:**  
No breakthroughs. Just stacked insights.  

This explicitly fights the lone genius myth.  

Each page shows:  

The person  
The ideas they inherited  
The ideas they passed on  

Almost like a dependency graph for thought.  

Imagine a README with:  
Alan Turing  
John McCarthy  
Marvin Minsky  
Geoff Hinton  
Transformer Models  

Thats powerful.
